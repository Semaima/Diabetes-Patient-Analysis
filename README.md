# Diabetes-Patient-Analysis
##My second project as a MeriSKILL intern.
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes
based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed
on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females.
Diagnostically predicted diabetes using SQL for data manipulation and analysis, focusing on diagnostic measurements.
Excel sheets were employed for organizing and preprocessing data for statistical analysis.
