# Diabetes-Patient-Analysis
## My Second Project as a MeriSKILL Intern

This dataset originates from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The primary objective is to diagnostically predict whether a patient has diabetes based on specific diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Notably, all patients in this dataset are females, as certain constraints were applied during the selection of instances from a larger database.

## Project Details:

- Diagnostically predicted diabetes using SQL for data manipulation and analysis.
- Focused on diagnostic measurements to make insightful predictions.
- Excel sheets were employed for organizing and preprocessing data, preparing it for statistical analysis.

## Interactive Dashboard:

Explore the interactive dashboard to gain deeper insights into the diagnostic predictions. The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing and understanding the relationships between diagnostic measurements and diabetes predictions.
